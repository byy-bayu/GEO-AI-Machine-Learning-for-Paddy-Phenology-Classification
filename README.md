# GEO-AI-Machine-Learning-for-Paddy-Phenology-Classification
Exploratory study on phenology phase classification of rice (waterâ€“fallow) using Sentinel-1 SAR ARD and polarization indices. A spatio-temporal approach with ML algorithms (RF, SVM, XGBoost) was applied, using 2024 planting data from Indramayu for labeling. Results were evaluated spatially and temporally.
